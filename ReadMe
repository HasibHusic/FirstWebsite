# FirstWebsite
My first personal website


I hope you enjoy looking at my first attempt at a website. 
I still followed alomng with a video but I made sure I understood the what I was coding before moving on.
I am officially 3 weeks into coding. I am getting much better and starting to understand the content a lot more.
